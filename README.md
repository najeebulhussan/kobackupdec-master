## 📖 Overview

**KoBackup Decryptor** (`kobackupdec`) is a Python 3 tool for decrypting Huawei *HiSuite* and *KoBackup* (Android app) encrypted backups. It supports both **v9** and **v10** backup structures.

When decrypting, it automatically:
- Reorganizes the output folder structure to mimic a typical Android filesystem
- Extracts and expands TAR archives (optional)
- Handles large files in chunks for memory efficiency

### ✨ What's New — GUI Edition

This fork adds a **full-featured graphical interface** built with tkinter, bringing the power of `kobackupdec` to users who prefer a visual workflow.

| Feature | CLI | GUI |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Decrypt full backups | ✅ | ✅ |
| Password verification before decrypt | — | ✅ |
| **Selective folder decryption** | — | ✅ |
| **Drag and Drop support** | — | ✅ |
| **Settings persistence** | — | ✅ |
| Pause / Resume / Stop controls | — | ✅ |
| Export decryption logs | — | ✅ |
| Open Output folder button | — | ✅ |
| Real-time color-coded log output | — | ✅ |
| Progress tracking with status updates | — | ✅ |
| Responsive dark-themed interface | — | ✅ |

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7** or later
- **pip** (Python package manager)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kobackupdec.git
cd kobackupdec

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📦 Building a Standalone Executable (.exe)

You can compile the GUI into a portable `.exe` file that requires zero setup (no Python installation needed):

1. Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller Pillow`
2. Run the build script: `python build.py`
3. The standalone application will be generated at `dist/KoBackupDecryptor.exe`.

### Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pycryptodome` | AES / PBKDF2 / HMAC cryptographic operations |
| `tkinterdnd2` | Drag and drop functionality for the GUI |
| `tkinter` | GUI framework (bundled with Python on most platforms) |

> **Note:** On some Linux distributions, tkinter may need to be installed separately:
> ```bash
> # Ubuntu / Debian
> sudo apt-get install python3-tk
>
> # Fedora
> sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
> ```

## 🖥️ Usage

### GUI Mode (Recommended)

Launch the graphical interface:

```bash
python kobackupdec_gui.py
```

#### GUI Workflow

1. **Enter Password** — Type your backup password (toggle visibility with 👁)
2. **Select Backup Folder** — Drag and drop your Huawei backup directory right into the application, or click **Browse**
3. **Select Destination** — Choose where to save decrypted files (pick a parent, name the output folder)
4. **Configure Options** — Toggle TAR expansion, writable permissions, and log verbosity
5. **Select Folders** — After setting the backup path, check/uncheck individual folders (pictures, video, audios, etc.) to decrypt only what you need
6. **Start Decryption** — Click **🔓 Start Decryption**
7. **Open Output** — When finished, click **📂 Open Output** to view your files immediately

#### GUI Controls

| Button | Function |
|---|---|
| 🔓 **Start Decryption** | Verifies password first, then begins decryption |
| ⏸ **Pause / ▶ Resume** | Temporarily halt and resume the process |
| ⏹ **Stop** | Cancel the decryption (partially decrypted files are kept) |
| 📂 **Open Output** | Opens destination folder in Windows Explorer (enabled after success) |
| **Export Log** | Save decryption logs to a text file for auditing |
| **Select All / Deselect All** | Quickly toggle all folder checkboxes |
| **🔍 Scan** | Re-scan backup directory for available folders |
| **Clear Log** | Clear the log output panel |

#### GUI Features

- **🔑 Password Verification** — Validates the password against `info.xml` before starting decryption. Wrong passwords are caught instantly.
- **📂 Selective Folder Decryption** — Only decrypt what you need (e.g., just pictures and contacts, skip video and apps).
- **💾 Settings Persistence** — The app remembers your selected folders and checkboxes across launches via `config.json`.
- **🖱️ Drag and Drop** — Seamlessly drop backup folders into the app instead of browsing manually.
- **📊 Real-Time Progress & Logs** — Status bar shows current phase. Export logs anytime.
- **🎨 Dark Theme** — Modern, responsive dark interface with color-coded log levels (green=info, yellow=warning, red=error).
- **📐 Responsive Layout** — Resizes gracefully from 600×500 to fullscreen. Folder checkboxes reflow automatically.

### CLI Mode

For scripting and automation, the original command-line interface is fully preserved:

```
usage: kobackupdec.py [-h] [-e] [-w] [-v] password backup_path dest_path

Huawei KoBackup decryptor version 20200705

positional arguments:
  password         user password for the backup
  backup_path      backup folder
  dest_path        decrypted backup folder

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -e, --expandtar  expand tar files
  -w, --writable   do not set RO permission on decrypted data
  -v, --verbose    verbose level, -v to -vvv
```

#### CLI Example

```bash
python kobackupdec.py -vvv 123456 "Z:\HUAWEI P30 Pro_2019-06-28 22.56.31" Z:\HiSuiteBackup
```

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>What backup formats are supported?</strong></summary>

Both **v9** and **v10** Huawei KoBackup / HiSuite backup structures. The tool looks for `info.xml` either at the root or inside `backupFiles1/`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it support HiSuite auto-generated passwords?</strong></summary>

No. The tool only supports backups encrypted with a **user-provided password**. HiSuite's self-generated password is not supported.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I get "No module named 'Crypto'" error</strong></summary>

Install `pycryptodome`:
```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```
If you have both `pycrypto` and `pycryptodome`, uninstall the old one first:
```bash
pip uninstall pycrypto
pip install pycryptodome
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I get "Wrong password" — is my password incorrect?</strong></summary>

The tool validates your password against the backup's `checkMsg` field. If the password is wrong, decryption will not proceed. Double-check the password you used when creating the backup in HiSuite/KoBackup.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I decrypt only specific folders (e.g., just photos)?</strong></summary>

**Yes!** In GUI mode, after selecting the backup folder, click **🔍 Scan** to list all available folders. Then uncheck everything you don't need and only the selected folders will be decrypted.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the GUI modify the original backup files?</strong></summary>

No. The original backup is only read, never modified. Decrypted files are written to the destination folder you specify.
</details>
